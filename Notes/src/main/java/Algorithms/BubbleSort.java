/**
 * This algorithm is known as bubble sort and works by comparing two elements at a time
 * and swapping the elements if the one that appears first is greater then the one that
 * comes after. It then shifts its pointers by 1 to compare the next two elements
 *
 * It requires two for loops as the entire array is not sorted in one pass but sorted by
 * having the largest value bubble to its correct position on each iteration.
 *              Quadratic Time
 *      BubbleSort is a O(N2) (N2 being N to the power of 2)
 *
 *
 * BubbleSort is therefore considered an inefficient algorithm because as the amount of data
 * increases the cost of operations increases exponentially.
