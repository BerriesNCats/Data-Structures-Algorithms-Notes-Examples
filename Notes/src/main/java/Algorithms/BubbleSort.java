/**
 *      This algorithm is known as bubble sort and works by comparing two elements at a time
 *      and swapping the elements if the one that appears first is greater then the one that
 *      comes after. It then shifts its pointers by 1 to compare the next two elements
 *
 *      It requires two for loops as the entire array is not sorted in one pass but sorted by
 *      having the largest value bubble to its correct position on each iteration.
 *
 *      BubbleSort is a O(n^2) algorithm performing in Quadratic Time - Stable
 *
 *      BubbleSort is therefore considered an inefficient algorithm because as the amount of data
 *          increases the cost of operations increases exponentially.
