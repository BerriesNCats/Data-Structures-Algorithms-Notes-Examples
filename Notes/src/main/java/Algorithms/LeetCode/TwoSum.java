/**
 * LeetCode #0001
 *
 * Given an array of integers 'numbers' and an integer 'target', return indices of the two numbers such that they add up
 * to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element
 * twice. You can return the answer in any order.
 *
 * Example Input
 *      numbers = [2, 7, 11, 13, 15], target = 13
 *          2 + 11 = target
 *
 *      Output = [0, 2]
