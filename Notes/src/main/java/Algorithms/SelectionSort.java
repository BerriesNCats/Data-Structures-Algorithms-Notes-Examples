/**
 *      Selection Sort works by traversing the array and looking for the largest element we can
 *       find from what has yet to be sorted.
 *      Once we have traversed the array and found the largest element, we swap it with the last
 *       element in the unsorted portion of the array.
 *
 *      Note that we could also look for the smallest element and swap it with the first element
 *       that has yet to be sorted.
 *
 *       Selection Sort is an O(N^2) algorithm performing in Quadratic Time - Unstable
