 * The Singleton is a design pattern that allows you to have one single instance of an object.

 * The unique instance is accessed through a get method. You can use 'Lazy Construction' on the
 * Singleton if memory space is a concern that will only create the single instance of the
 * Singleton when and if it is called.
